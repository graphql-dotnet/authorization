A toolset for authorizing access to graph types for [GraphQL.NET](https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet).

Provides the following packages:

You can get all preview versions from [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/orgs/graphql-dotnet/packages?repo_name=authorization).
Note that GitHub requires authentication to consume the feed. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/packages/publishing-and-managing-packages/about-github-packages#authenticating-to-github-packages).

# Usage

* Register the authorization classes in your DI container - `IAuthorizationEvaluator`, `AuthorizationSettings`, and the `AuthorizationValidationRule`.
* Provide a custom `UserContext` class that implements `IProvideClaimsPrincipal`.
* Add policies to the `AuthorizationSettings`.
* Apply a policy to a GraphType or Field (which implement `IProvideMetadata`) using `AuthorizeWith(string policy)`.
* Make sure the `AuthorizationValidationRule` is registered with your Schema (depending on your server implementation, you may only need to register it in your DI container)
* The `AuthorizationValidationRule` will run and verify the policies based on the registered policies.
* You can write your own `IAuthorizationRequirement`.
* Use `GraphQLAuthorize` attribute if using Schema First syntax.

# Examples

1. Fully functional basic [Console sample](src/BasicSample/Program.cs).

2. Fully functional [ASP.NET Core sample](src/Harness/Program.cs).

3. GraphType first syntax - use `AuthorizeWith`.

```c#
public class MyType : ObjectGraphType
{
    public MyType()
    {
        this.AuthorizeWith("AdminPolicy");
        Field<StringGraphType>("name").AuthorizeWith("SomePolicy");
    }
}
```

3. Schema first syntax - use `GraphQLAuthorize` attribute.

```c#
[GraphQLAuthorize(Policy = "MyPolicy")]
public class MutationType
{
    [GraphQLAuthorize(Policy = "AnotherPolicy")]
    public async Task<string> CreateSomething(MyInput input)
    {
        return Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
    }
}
```

# Known Issues

* It is currently not possible to add a policy to Input objects using Schema first approach.
